# RingDAO Ecosystem: Request for Proposal (RFP)

## Title: Open and Scalable DAO Application Platform with AI Agent Integration for Next-Generation Governance

---

## Background and Problem Statement

DAO governance currently faces the following key challenges:

1. **Lack of open-source, compatible platforms**  
   - Existing tools (e.g., Tally) are closed-source, lack extensibility, and have high integration costs for other chains and DAOs, creating significant **vendor lock-in risks**.  
   - RingDAO aims to build an open, extensible platform compatible with OpenZeppelin Governance to improve flexibility and governance efficiency.

2. **Cross-chain governance integration challenges**  
   - The [XAccount DAO Tool Grant](https://github.com/ringecosystem/collaboration/blob/master/grant/projects/new-xAccount.md) introduced a tool for generating cross-chain proposals. However, its application requires integration with existing platforms like Tally and AragonDAO, posing business development and technical risks.  
   - An open, **cross-chain agnostic application platform** could address these integration pain points and accelerate the adoption of the XAccount DAO Tool.

3. **Low participation and high governance costs**  
   - DAO governance struggles with low participation rates and high decision-making costs. Advances in AI and **AI Agents** present an opportunity to tackle these issues.  
   - The potential of **AI Agent Swarms** positions DAOs as core decision-making modules in decentralized systems, further enhancing their autonomy. (More discussion available [here](https://x.com/ringecosystem/status/1875787573848846464)).

## Objectives and Solutions

We propose a phased approach to develop an open-source, cross-chain DAO application platform, focusing on integration extensibility, governance efficiency, and participation enhancement. The key objectives are:

1. **Open-source DAO application platform**  
   - Address integration and extensibility issues in existing closed platforms by supporting **OpenZeppelin Governance** and prioritizing **Darwinia Chain** and RingDAO's on-chain governance needs.

2. **Cross-chain governance integration**  
   - Integrate the **XAccount DAO Tool** to enable cross-chain proposal creation and execution without relying on closed-source solutions.

3. **AI Agent Delegation and Swarm Integration**  
   - Introduce **AI Agent delegation capabilities** to automate governance tasks for Delegates, such as proposal review, voting, and social media engagement.  
   - Explore **AI Agent Swarm** applications, proposing features for autonomous DAO module creation and integration.

## RFP Phases and Budget

### Phase 1: Open-Source DAO Application Platform (Done)
- **Objective**: Research existing open-source UI solutions and develop a prototype platform supporting OpenZeppelin Governance and Darwinia Chain.  
- **Duration**: 1 month  
- **Budget**: 2,500 USD  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  - Research existing open-source UI frameworks (e.g., Snapshot, Aragon, Nouns) and evaluate their extensibility and suitability.  
  - Develop an initial interface compatible with **OpenZeppelin Governor**, RingDAO/KtonDAO/DCDAO.  
- References: [DeGov.AI Grant Phase 1](https://github.com/ringecosystem/collaboration/blob/master/grant/projects/degov.md)

### Phase 2: XAccount DAO Tool Integration (Delivering)
- **Objective**: Integrate the **XAccount DAO Tool** into the platform to enable cross-chain proposal creation and execution.  
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Budget**: 1500 USD  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  - Link the XAccount DAO Tool within the platform's Proposal Action module, supporting the creation and visualization of cross-chain proposals.  
  - Provide a user-friendly UI and interaction experience.

### Phase 3: AI Agentic Delegate
- **Objective**: Leverage existing AI Agent frameworks to develop automated governance functions and test their applications.  
- **Duration**: 1 months  
- **Budget**: 2,000 USD  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  1. **Proposal Monitoring and Agent Trigger Mechanism**  
     - Establish a monitoring system that tracks proposal events in real-time. Upon detecting a new proposal, the system should prompt the Agent to utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to perform relevant tasks.
     - Implementation Approach
       - **Proposal Listener**: Utilize DeGov.AI APIs or indexer APIs to monitor the creation, updates, and status changes of proposals.
       - **Event Trigger**: When the listener detects a new proposal event, it should trigger the Agent to execute corresponding tasks, such as generating summaries or sending comment reminders. 
  2. **MCP Server Integration**  
     - Integrate existing open-source MCP Servers to implement the following functionalities, minimizing the need for custom development:
       - **Proposal Reading**: Parse proposal content to extract key information.
       - **Proposal Comment Reminders**: Monitor the proposal's comment section and notify relevant stakeholders of new discussions.
       - **Community Summarization**: Aggregate discussions from social media platforms and generate concise summaries.
       - **On-Chain Voting**: Execute on-chain voting operations through interfaces provided by MCP Servers.
       - **Social Media Interaction**: Integrate with social media platforms to automate interaction processes.
  3. **Setup AI Agentic Delegate on DeGov.AI Platfrom** (To be supported by existing ecosystem service providers)
     - AI agent session key management and how to bind agent session key to Agentic Delegate: https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov/issues/121
  4. **Recommendations for RFP Inclusion**
     - **Programming Language**: Specify the programming language(s) intended for development (e.g., TypeScript).
     - **MCP SDK**: List the MCP SDK(s) planned for use, including their versions.
     - **Agent Framework**: Indicate the Agent framework or automation tools to be employed (e.g., OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain).
     - **Language Model**: Clearly state the language model(s) to be utilized, along with their respective versions (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, OpenAI GPT-4).
     - **MCP Server Integration**: Enumerate the MCP Servers intended for integration and outline their specific functionalities.

### Phase 4: Swarm Coordination Between Multiple Agentic Delegates (Optionalï¼Œ Researching)
- **Background**: The DAO is already established and has deployed multiple AI Agentic Delegates. Accelerates proposal processing, reduces human intervention, and strengthens decentralized governance. 
- **Objective**: To organize these Delegates into a collaborative AI Swarm, thereby enhancing the DAO's autonomy and decision-making efficiency.
- **Duration**: 1 months  
- **Budget**: 1000 USD
- **Key Tasks**:    
  - **Solution and Design of Swarm Coordination for AI Agentic Delegates**
     - Ensuring security and trust mechanisms to prevent potential misuse of authority by the Delegates.
     - Coordination use cases between AI Agentic Delegates

### Phase 5: Creating AI Agent Swarm using DAO as as the Decision-Making Module (RFP in drafting)
- **Objective**: Building an AI Swarm from Scratch and Transforming It into a Governable DAO
- **Background**: The objective is to construct an AI Swarm composed of multiple AI agents, each representing distinct stakeholders with specific addresses and assigned weights.
- **Requirements**: The Swarm must collaboratively manage certain permissions or assets and make decisions based on predefined rules, referred to as the Swarm Constitution.
- **Duration**: 2-3 months
- **Budget**: 8500 USD  
- **Key Tasks**:    
   - **Solution**:
     1. **On-Chain Governance Rules**: Record all agent addresses, weights, permissions, and governance rules on the blockchain to establish a DAO.
     2. **Automated Deployment**: Utilize the above information to automatically deploy DAO smart contracts, generating a DAO Treasury address.
     3. **Token Distribution**: Distribute governance tokens to each agent owner's address proportionally based on their assigned weights.
     4. **Binding Agentic Delegates**: Employ DeGov.AI's technology to create an Agentic Delegate for each owner address and bind it to the corresponding AI agent's session key.
     5. **Asset Management**: All permissions and assets are within the DAO's Treasury address, managed collectively by the Swarm according to the predefined rules.
   - **Advantages**: This approach enables the AI Swarm to achieve full autonomy with governance capabilities, allowing it to independently manage assets and permissions.
   - **Challenges**: Ensuring the security of smart contracts and the rationality of governance rules is crucial to prevent potential governance attacks.
