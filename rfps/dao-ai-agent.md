# RingDAO Ecosystem: Request for Proposal (RFP)

## Title: Open and Scalable DAO Application Platform with AI Agent Integration for Next-Generation Governance

---

## Background and Problem Statement

DAO governance currently faces the following key challenges:

1. **Lack of open-source, compatible platforms**  
   - Existing tools (e.g., Tally) are closed-source, lack extensibility, and have high integration costs for other chains and DAOs, creating significant **vendor lock-in risks**.  
   - RingDAO aims to build an open, extensible platform compatible with OpenZeppelin Governance to improve flexibility and governance efficiency.

2. **Cross-chain governance integration challenges**  
   - The [XAccount DAO Tool Grant](https://github.com/ringecosystem/collaboration/blob/master/grant/projects/new-xAccount.md) introduced a tool for generating cross-chain proposals. However, its application requires integration with existing platforms like Tally and AragonDAO, posing business development and technical risks.  
   - An open, **cross-chain agnostic application platform** could address these integration pain points and accelerate the adoption of the XAccount DAO Tool.

3. **Low participation and high governance costs**  
   - DAO governance struggles with low participation rates and high decision-making costs. Advances in AI and **AI Agents** present an opportunity to tackle these issues.  
   - The potential of **AI Agent Swarms** positions DAOs as core decision-making modules in decentralized systems, further enhancing their autonomy. (More discussion available [here](https://x.com/ringecosystem/status/1875787573848846464)).

## Objectives and Solutions

We propose a phased approach to develop an open-source, cross-chain DAO application platform, focusing on integration extensibility, governance efficiency, and participation enhancement. The key objectives are:

1. **Open-source DAO application platform**  
   - Address integration and extensibility issues in existing closed platforms by supporting **OpenZeppelin Governance** and prioritizing **Darwinia Chain** and RingDAO's on-chain governance needs.

2. **Cross-chain governance integration**  
   - Integrate the **XAccount DAO Tool** to enable cross-chain proposal creation and execution without relying on closed-source solutions.

3. **AI Agent Delegation and Swarm Integration**  
   - Introduce **AI Agent delegation capabilities** to automate governance tasks for Delegates, such as proposal review, voting, and social media engagement.  
   - Explore **AI Agent Swarm** applications, proposing features for autonomous DAO module creation and integration.

## RFP Phases and Budget

### Phase 1: Open-Source DAO Application Platform
- **Objective**: Research existing open-source UI solutions and develop a prototype platform supporting OpenZeppelin Governance and Darwinia Chain.  
- **Duration**: 1 month  
- **Budget**: 2,500 USD  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  - Research existing open-source UI frameworks (e.g., Snapshot, Aragon, Nouns) and evaluate their extensibility and suitability.  
  - Develop an initial interface compatible with **OpenZeppelin Governor**, RingDAO/KtonDAO/DCDAO.  

### Phase 2: XAccount DAO Tool Integration
- **Objective**: Integrate the **XAccount DAO Tool** into the platform to enable cross-chain proposal creation and execution.  
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Budget**: 1000 USD  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  - Link the XAccount DAO Tool within the platform's Proposal Action module, supporting the creation and visualization of cross-chain proposals.  
  - Provide a user-friendly UI and interaction experience.  

### Phase 3: AI Agent Delegation and Swarm Features Exploration(WIP)
- **Objective**: Leverage existing AI Agent frameworks to develop automated governance functions and test their applications.  
- **Duration**: 3-4 months  
- **Budget**: 12,000 USD  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  1. **AI Agent Prototype Testing**  
     - Build a prototype based on existing AI Agent frameworks, enabling proposal reading, social media interaction (e.g., automated commenting and vote outreach), and on-chain voting.  
  2. **Application Testing**  
     - Test the AI Agent's performance in real-world governance scenarios within DCDAO, collect feedback, and optimize features.  
  3. **AI Swarm Integration Design**  
     - Design and propose features for autonomous DAO module creation and integration, focusing on Swarm decision-making capabilities.
