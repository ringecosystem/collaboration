## What is an RFP?

An RFP (Request for Proposals) is a declaration of interest for others to submit a grant or a treasury application regarding a specific project.

If you find an open RFP here that you think you can address, feel free to submit a [grant application](../grant/README.md) or a [treasury proposal](../darwinia_treasury_proposal_template.md).
