# Collaboration

Welcome to the RingDAO community!

This is the collaboration hub for the RingDAO community, where we discuss improvements, new features, bug bounties, grant funding, and more.

You can participate in the following ways:

1. If you are an experienced individual developer or team without a specific idea to collaborate on, check out the issues list [here](https://github.com/ringecosystem/collaboration/issues), starting with `RFP (Request for Proposals)`. These are ideas that the RingDAO community is looking for collaborators to work on.
2. If you find an interesting RFP, that's a great start. Please follow the [Grant Template](./grant/template.md) and submit a pull request. We will provide feedback and help you complete the grant application.
3. If you already have an idea, you can submit a pull request with the [Grant Template](./grant/template.md) filled out. We will provide feedback and help you complete the grant application.
4. If you discover a bug or vulnerability in the RingDAO ecosystem, please report it on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/ringdao/information/). We take security seriously and will reward you for your contribution.
