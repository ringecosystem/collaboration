SEPTMEBER Marketing Report
Over the month of September, I focused on closing a sale with Unlock DAO(which was unsuccessful), continued relationship with ENS DAO and monthly marketing tasks to help launch announcements.

Here are the details below:

Closing Unlock DAO: Unlock DAO has been in the sales pipeline for two months now. In september, I attended 2 of their weekly calls and had a one-on-one session with the Unlock DAO Marketing Steward, Ceci Sakura. Afterwards I faced a bit of resistance and was later asked to send an offer; which was reviewed, sadly, it didn't make the cut. They will rather want to build their own dashboard and more. I will still keep following through with them, though now as a medium priority. 

ENS DAO relationship: Attended 2 of their weekly calls and spoke about DeGov which got us mention again on their forum again on 30th September, 2025 https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-2025-meetings-tuesdays-at-2pm-utc-currently-10-00-am-et/20078/70.
Currently, ENS DAO remains a medium priority as we can get possible funding next year during the service provider funding season. I also did get feedback concerning the pause in function of the DeGov Agent which I floated to Bear Wang. In addition, they loved the colour themes on DeGov.AI voting interface.

Monthly Marketing Tasks: I also did identify at least 3 key opinion leaders or community leaders to use during announcements for the launch of 3 DAOs in September; (Carv DAO, HAI DAO and Lisk DAO). Also did familiarisation with these DAOs and will pursue 4 more DAOs in the sales pipeline this October.

Impact:
1. Continued representation of the DeGov Product.
2. Relationship building for future sales.

Suggestion:
1. Content volume is low. Produce more content.
2. Fast product experiments needed and I think we should pause with the weekly launches and restrategize to consolidate on this little traction our prroduct has gotten thus far.
