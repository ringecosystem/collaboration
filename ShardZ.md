# ShardZ
## Project Description

ShardZ aims to disrupt the traditional streaming landscape by building a secure, transparent, and user-centric content ecosystem on the Concordium blockchain. Harnessing Concordium's innovative features, we have a vision to revolutionise how content is created, consumed, and monetized:

#### Empowering Creators: 
ShardZ will elevate content into unique digital assets seamlessly, allowing creators to mint their videos effortlessly and take full ownership of their work.
#### Democratising Investment: 
Real World Tokenization of these video NFTs will democratise access to exclusive content and digital collectibles, empowering investors to trade fractional ownership and support their favourite creators.
#### Uncompromising Security: 
Concordium's built-in identity layer and emphasis on security will ensure the safety of user data and transactions, fostering trust within the platform.
#### Transparent Revenue Sharing:
ShardZ will implement a fair and transparent revenue distribution system leveraging smart contracts. Creators, investors, and viewers will all benefit from an equitable model.
#### Blockchain Interoperability: 
To ensure future adaptability, ShardZ will prioritise flexibility across various blockchain networks, allowing for seamless interaction and transactions.

### Development Roadmap


**Long-Term Plans:**

Following successful integration, our long-term plans involve:

* **Community Building:** Collaborating with Darwinia to foster a strong user base within both ecosystems.
* **Cross-Chain Collaboration:** Exploring potential integrations with other DApps within the Darwinia ecosystem to enhance Shardz's functionalities.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously evaluating and improving the cross-chain bridge functionality based on user feedback and evolving blockchain technologies.

### Milestones:

**Milestone 1 (Month 1st): Cross-Chain Integration Foundation (2 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Establish the groundwork for cross-chain functionality between Shardz and Darwinia Network.
* **Activities:**
    * Conduct in-depth research on Darwinia's Ring Network capabilities for cross-chain bridge integration.
    * Analyze Shardz's codebase to identify integration points for the bridge.
    * Develop a detailed technical document outlining the chosen integration approach, focusing on functionalities that enhance Shardz (e.g., cross-chain token transfers, potential cross-chain NFT transfers).
    * Define success criteria for this milestone, including completion of technical documentation and a high-level integration plan.
* **Funding:**
    $5000
* **Schedule:**
    * Weeks 1-2 of the project.

**Milestone 2 (Month 2nd): Cross-Chain Bridge Development & Environment Setup (2 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Develop the core functionalities of the cross-chain bridge and set up a testing environment.
* **Activities:**
    * Integrate necessary libraries within Shardz's codebase to connect with Darwinia's Ring Network.
    * Develop smart contracts on Shardz's native blockchain to handle cross-chain interactions for assets (focusing on Shardz tokens initially, potentially including NFTs in future milestones). This may involve functionalities for:
        * Locking assets on Shardz before initiating a cross-chain transfer.
        * Minting and burning corresponding wrapped assets on the destination blockchain (if applicable).
        * Verifying cross-chain transactions and facilitating asset delivery upon successful completion.
    * Set up a development environment that facilitates seamless communication and testing between Shardz and Darwinia for cross-chain functionalities.
    * Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of the integrated libraries and smart contracts.
* **Funding:**
    $5000
* **Schedule:**
    * Weeks 3-4 of the project.

**Milestone 3 (Months 3-4): Advanced Cross-Chain Functionalities & Security Audits (6 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Implement advanced cross-chain functionalities (potentially including NFTs) and conduct security audits.
* **Activities:**
    * Further develop smart contracts to enable cross-chain transfers of NFTs (if applicable), considering factors like token standards and compatibility.
    * Conduct thorough security audits of all deployed smart contracts by a reputable security firm.
    * Define success criteria for this milestone, including functional smart contract deployment for chosen cross-chain functionalities and passing security audits.
* **Funding:**
    $9000
* **Schedule:**
    * Weeks 5-10 of the project.

**Milestone 4 (Month 5): User Interface Integration & Testing (2 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Design and integrate a user-friendly interface within Shardz to manage cross-chain interactions.
* **Activities:**
    * Design and develop a user-friendly interface within Shardz to manage cross-chain interactions, focusing on Shardz functionalities. This may include functionalities for:
        * Initiating cross-chain transfers of tokens (and potentially NFTs).
        * Monitoring the status of cross-chain transactions.
        * Viewing asset balances across different blockchains (if applicable).
    * Conduct comprehensive internal testing of the user interface and cross-chain functionalities.
    * Define success criteria for this milestone, including a functional user interface for cross-chain interactions and passing internal testing.
* **Funding:**
    $5000
* **Schedule:**
    * Weeks 11-12 of the project.

**Milestone 5 (Month 6): Deployment & Launch (2 Weeks)**

* **Objective:** Successfully launch the cross-chain bridge functionality within the Shardz platform.
* **Activities:**
    * Deploy the integrated cross-chain bridge functionality within the Shardz platform.
    * Conduct final security assessments and penetration testing.
    * Launch the cross-chain bridge feature to the Shardz user base with clear documentation and tutorials.
* **Funding:**
    $3000
