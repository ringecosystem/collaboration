# Services Provided

## Security Audit

Compared to the previous quarter, we will continue to provide security audit services for the Darwinia chain and its core applications in the RingDAO ecosystem. Security is a top priority for us. The following are the key areas we will focus on:

- **Darwinia chain runtime upgrade audit**: We will conduct a comprehensive audit of the runtime upgrade process to ensure the security and stability of the Darwinia chain after each upgrade.
- **Application feature audit**: We are rolling out new features in these core applications, and we will provide periodic audits to identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities before public release.
- **Hotfix audit**: In the event of any urgent security issues, we will provide hotfix audits to quickly address vulnerabilities and ensure the security of the ecosystem.
- **Security Best Practices**: We will continue to promote security best practices within the RingDAO ecosystem, providing guidance and support to developers and users.

## Darwinia Chain Development and Maintenance

The Darwinia Chain is a key component of the RingDAO ecosystem, and our team is dedicated to its continuous development and maintenance. Our services mainly focus on enhancing the chain's performance, security, and stability, as well as integrating new features to support the ecosystem's growth.

For the upcoming quarter, we will focus on the following areas:

- **Runtime Development and Maintenance**: 
    - Continuous enhancement and maintenance of the runtime environment to ensure optimal performance and security.
    - Periodic performance benchmarks and integration tests to ensure compatibility with Polkadot and other dependencies.
    - Periodic on-chain runtime upgrades to introduce new features and improvements.
- **Node Development and Maintenance**:
    - Ongoing improvements to Darwinia's core node infrastructure to maintain scalability and stability.
    - Regular performance assessments and optimizations, as well as continuous stability monitoring.
- **Live Network Maintenance**:
    - Monthly reviews of governance proposals for both Darwinia and Crab networks to ensure smooth operation and community engagement.
- **DApp Development**: Development of decentralized applications running on the Darwinia blockchain.
- **Technical Assistance**: 
    - Support for Darwinia Improvement Proposals (DIPs) and emergency on-chain support.
    - Assistance with governance proposal implementation and related technical challenges.

## Application Coordination

We will continue to coordinate the development and integration of various applications within the RingDAO ecosystem, ensuring that these applications are aligned with the overall goals of the ecosystem and delivered to the community.

For the upcoming quarter, we will focus on the following areas:

- **DeGov.AI phase 2 and phase 3**: After successfully delivering the first phase of DeGov.AI in the previous quarter, we will continue to develop and enhance the DeGov.AI application, focusing on integrating AI capabilities to improve governance processes and decision-making.
- **Balancer V3 deployment on Darwinia**: The original SnowSwap in our ecosystem has not been updated for a long time, and the DeFi landscape has evolved significantly. We plan to deploy Balancer V3 on the Darwinia chain, providing a more efficient and flexible liquidity solution for users.
- **KTON Index Fund application development**: An application that allows users to invest in KTON tokens through a diversified index fund, providing a more accessible and user-friendly investment option.
- **Track and Monitor Applications**: We will continue to monitor the progress of all applications maintained by the RingDAO ecosystem, identifying potential issues and solving them in a timely manner. This includes providing technical support, coordinating development efforts, and ensuring that applications are aligned with the ecosystem's goals.

## Ecosystem Integration and Development

We will continue to drive the integration of third-party systems, there is a tracked list of integration tasks and progress at [ringecosystem/integration](https://github.com/ringecosystem/integration). We will focus on solving these integration tasks and enhancing the ecosystem's interoperability and functionality with the latest developments of the Web3 landscape.

Besides, we will also focus on the following areas:

- **Improve the monitoring system**: Enhance the application server monitoring system to cover key indicators at the business and system levels, including performance, resource usage, error tracking, and alert configuration to ensure stability and rapid incident response.
- **Daily Maintenance of Blockchain Nodes**: Responsible for the daily maintenance of blockchain nodes, including version upgrades, network connections, block synchronization monitoring, and problem handling to ensure long-term stable operation.
- **Support CI/CD Pipeline Construction and Optimization**: Support the construction and optimization of CI/CD pipelines, including automated deployment, construction optimization, and troubleshooting, to improve development and operational efficiency.

## DeGov.AI Development and Support

DeGov.AI is a key application in the RingDAO ecosystem, and we will continue to develop and support it in the upcoming quarter. We will focus on the following areas:

- **Phase 2 Development**: After phase 3 delivery, we will put more effort into the delivery of phase 2, which includes the notification system, dao's settings, and other features.
- **Phase 3 Enhancements**: We will continue to enhance the ai agent capabilities of DeGov.AI based on user feedback and community needs.
- **Build DeGov for More DAOs**: We will work on building DeGov.AI for more DAOs in the Web3 ecosystem, and provide technical or community support in the process.
