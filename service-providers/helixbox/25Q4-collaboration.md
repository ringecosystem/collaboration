# Overview

As we enter the fourth quarter of 2025, we reflect on a period of significant activity. Over the previous quarters, Helixbox Labs has been deeply involved in the development and security of the RingDAO ecosystem, with a special focus on the DeGov.AI project and the stabilization of the Darwinia chain. We have made substantial progress, evolving DeGov.AI from a concept into a functional product and onboarding over 15 DAOs to the platform. We are pleased with the community's positive feedback and engagement.

In this proposal, we summarize our achievements from the previous quarter and outline our plans and objectives for the upcoming one. We are committed to continuing our efforts to contribute to the growth and success of the RingDAO ecosystem.

# What we have completed in the previous quarter

This section recaps the services promised in the previous quarter and highlights our key achievements. For the full Q3 proposal, please see https://github.com/ringecosystem/collaboration/blob/master/service-providers/helixbox/25Q3-collaboration.md. We have completed numerous tasks; for more details, please refer to our monthly reports.

Monthly Reports:

- July: https://medium.com/ringdao/monthly-sync-july-2025-329aa9f6f322
- August: https://medium.com/ringdao/monthly-sync-august-2025-1f3e4a5f0f7c
- September: https://medium.com/ringdao/monthly-report-sep-2025-ecc26722a5cc

Some highlights:

- Reorganized the Telegram presence from separate groups into a single group with different topics. This change makes it easier for community members to follow and participate in discussions.
- DeGov.AI has made significant progress over the past quarter. Many features have been implemented, and we released over 15 versions. We have onboarded more than 15 DAOs to the platform and received positive feedback from the community. Please see the reports above for details.

Some tasks went beyond our original plan, including:

- The Balancer V3 development on the Darwinia chain has been postponed to the next quarter due to limited resources. The core developer assigned to this task redirected their efforts to DeGov.AI development, which was more urgent and important for the ecosystem.
- The KTON Index Fund application was also part of the previous quarter's plan. However, the fund's vision has evolved, and we are now exploring better ideas to make the KTONDAO community more active and engaged. We have already discussed some initial ideas in the last ecosystem call and will continue to refine them.

# The services we provide in the upcoming quarter

## Security Audit

Security is undoubtedly the top priority for all projects in the RingDAO ecosystem. In the upcoming quarter, we will continue to provide security audit services for existing applications and the Darwinia chain. The key areas of focus will be:

- Monitoring and tracking critical security issues on the Darwinia chain and its core applications, providing timely hotfix audits to address any urgent vulnerabilities.
- Carefully reviewing new features and updates in the core applications, providing comprehensive audits to identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities before public release.

## Existing Products Maintenance

Due to limited resources, we will focus most of our efforts on our core project, currently DeGov.AI, while dedicating the necessary effort to maintaining existing products. We will also carefully consider new features and improvements for existing products, implementing only the most valuable ones.

The key areas of focus will be:

- Continuing to maintain and improve the Darwinia chain and its ecosystem applications, such as Darwinia Staking, Explorer, and Name Service.
- Providing timely DevOps support and bug fixes for existing products to ensure their stability and reliability.
- Actively providing technical support and assistance to community members who encounter issues with existing products.
- Actively maintaining the fundamental infrastructure of these applications, such as API services and RPC nodes.

## DeGov.AI Development and Marketing

DeGov.AI remains the core project we are focused on delivering in the upcoming quarter. DeGov.AI is a brand consisting of two sub-products: DeGov Square and DeGovX. In the previous quarter, we made significant progress on DeGov Square, delivering critical features such as compatibility with multiple governance model variants, email notifications, and mobile UI adaptation. In mid-September, we introduced a new sub-product, DeGovX, an automated X (formerly Twitter) governance agent that helps DAOs manage their governance processes more efficiently. In the upcoming quarter, we will dedicate our efforts to both DeGov Square and DeGovX.

The key areas of focus will be:

- Continuing to develop and improve DeGov Square, polishing it to be the premier governance platform for DAOs engaged in on-chain governance.
- Actively developing and promoting DeGovX. As a very early-stage product, it requires extensive work, including product design, technical implementation, marketing, and community building. Currently, it only supports DAOs within DeGov Square; we plan to make it compatible with other governance platforms like Snapshot and Polkadot to expand DeGov.AI's influence into more ecosystems.
- Marketing and community building around DeGov.AI. We have welcomed a new member, Eve, to our team as Marketing Manager. She will help us promote DeGov.AI to more communities and onboard more DAOs to the platform.
- Continue to develop and improve DeGov Square, and polish it to be the best governance platform for DAOs who are doing on-chain governance.
- Actively develop and promote DeGovX, as it's a very early stage product, there are tons of work to do, including the product design, technical implementation, marketing and community building, etc. Plus, it currently only support the DAOs in the DeGov Square, we need to make it compatible with other governance platforms, such as Snapshot, Polkadot. In this way, we can expand
the DeGov.AI influence to more ecosystems.
- Marketing and community building around DeGov.AI, we have introduce a new member Eve to join our team as the marketing manager, she will help us to promote DeGov.AI to more communities and onboard more DAOs to the platform.
