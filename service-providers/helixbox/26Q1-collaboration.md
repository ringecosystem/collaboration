# Overview

We have now entered the first quarter of 2026. Reflecting on the past year, Helixbox Labs has been deeply involved in the development of the RingDAO ecosystem, focusing particularly on the DeGov.AI project and the stability of the Darwinia chain. Over the previous quarters, we have gradually shifted from chain-centric development to application-oriented development, seeing DeGov.AI evolve from a concept to a functional product. It has been an exciting journey!

Looking ahead to 2026, we are filled with enthusiasm and determination. In this proposal, we recap our achievements from the previous quarter and outline our plans and objectives for the upcoming one. We remain committed to contributing to the growth and success of the RingDAO ecosystem.

# Completed Achievements in the Previous Quarter

All services promised in the previous quarter have seen significant progress. See the full Q4 proposal at https://github.com/ringecosystem/collaboration/blob/master/service-providers/helixbox/25Q4-collaboration.md for details. In this section, we highlight our key achievements.

Highlights:
1. The DeGov.AI core product (https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov) has been significantly polished over the last quarter, with over 10 versions released. The current version is stable and ready for more DAOs to onboard.
2. Another DeGov.AI product, https://x.com/degov_x, has been actively developed. We migrated the DeGovX feature from the original repository to a new private repository to protect the codebase and successfully integrated DAOs from DeGov Square and select DAOs from the Snapshot platform. The momentum is building! Although we faced challenges during the integration process, we overcame them to deliver a functional product. There are still significant improvements to be made in this new quarter.
3. We actively advanced the Crab chain sunset plan to reduce the maintenance costs of the RingDAO ecosystem. The Crab chain sunset proposal has been approved by the community (see https://github.com/orgs/ringecosystem/discussions/43 and https://github.com/orgs/ringecosystem/discussions/44). We are currently working on the technical details and aim to complete the sunset process this quarter.
4. We actively advanced the DeGov.AI marketing plan to onboard more DAOs to the platform. We experimented with various marketing strategies, including X account management, content marketing, and grant programs. While the results have not yet met our expectations, we will continue to iterate and polish the DeGovX product as a gateway to drive traffic to DeGov.AI.
5. Regarding KtonDAO, we provided technical support for the KTON community to convert part of their treasury assets to BTC. The process was smooth, and the community is satisfied with the outcome.
6. Regarding the Balancer V3 development on the Darwinia chain mentioned in the previous proposal, we have re-evaluated the plan and decided to suspend development due to resource constraints. Resources must be focused on the highest priority tasks, specifically DeGov.AI development. We hope to revisit Balancer V3 development in the future when more resources become available.
7. We also explored the possibility of a Token Generation Event (TGE) for the DeGov.AI project. We conducted research and preparations; however, after careful consideration, we decided to postpone the TGE plan to focus on product development and marketing first. We believe that a solid product and a strong community are the foundations for a successful TGE.

This concludes the highlights. We hope the community is satisfied with our work over the last quarter. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.

# Services Planned for the Upcoming Quarter

## Security Audit

Security remains our top priority and deserves a dedicated section. As in previous quarters, we will continue to provide security audit services for the RingDAO ecosystem, covering both existing applications and the Darwinia chain. 

## Maintenance of Existing Services

In addition to security audits, we will continue to provide maintenance services for the RingDAO ecosystem. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Chain Maintenance and Upgrades**: As we proceed with the Crab chain sunset this quarter, our primary focus will shift to the maintenance and upgrade of the Darwinia chain. We will monitor chain performance and stability, fix bugs, and implement necessary upgrades or improvements.
- **Application Maintenance and Upgrades**: We will continue to maintain and upgrade existing applications within the RingDAO ecosystem, such as the bridge, DEX, and other dApps. This involves bug fixing, performance improvements, and feature additions as needed, ensuring applications run smoothly and efficiently for users.
- **Community Support**: We will continue to provide community support for various organizations within the RingDAO ecosystem, such as KtonDAO and RCG. This includes answering questions, offering technical assistance, and addressing community concerns.

## DeGov.AI Development and Marketing

The DeGov.AI project is our main focus this quarter and is currently the most significant application in the RingDAO ecosystem. The current DeGov Square is a relatively stable product, ready for more DAOs to onboard. Consequently, our primary focus for DeGov Square will be marketing, aiming to onboard more DAOs and attract target users.

DeGovX is also a key part of our marketing strategy to drive traffic to DeGov.AI. We envision DeGovX becoming a growing presence on X, bringing more attention to DeGov.AI. Therefore, our top priority this quarter involves polishing DeGovX to make it competitive enough to attract a broader user base.

Beyond these two main products, we will actively explore collaboration opportunities with other ecosystems to find new customers for DeGov.AI. In the previous quarter, we initiated exploration with the Sky ecosystem, and we will continue to follow up on this opportunity.

In summary, our primary focus this quarter is the DAO governance space: polishing our existing products under the DeGov.AI umbrella and actively seeking collaboration opportunities to onboard more DAOs, ultimately generating revenue to sustain project development.
