## Scope of Work

### Integration and Ecosystem Development

We are committed to continuously advancing integration with third-party systems to enhance the RingDAO ecosystem. Relevant work can be tracked on the [GitHub Integration Issues](https://github.com/ringecosystem/integration/issues) page, where any discussions, ideas, or improvement suggestions related to integration can be proposed.

Among the various integration tasks, the following areas will be prioritized:

#### Paymaster Solution Upgrade

As the Helixbox product evolves, our goal is to simplify the Web3 experience and attract more users. To achieve this, Helixbox utilizes [Paymasters](https://www.erc4337.io/docs/paymasters/introduction) to lower the entry barriers for users.

Currently, we have chosen [Pimlico](https://pimlico.io/) as our Paymasters service provider based on thorough research. However, as our business expands, we require greater flexibility and scalability to support multiple blockchain networks while ensuring a faster and more secure user experience. Therefore, our key tasks include:

1. Maintaining close collaboration with Pimlico to address new blockchain or token requirements, ensuring the stability of the current solution.
2. Developing an in-house Paymasters system to better meet our business needs, increasing system independence and security.

#### Swap Integration

With the continuous upgrades of Helixbox, the Swap feature has become a crucial component of Web3 business development. Since many mature and secure Swap solutions already exist in the market, there is no need to build a Swap system from scratch. Instead, we will strategically select service providers based on business requirements.

Currently, we use [0x.org](https://0x.org/) as our primary Swap routing provider. Moving forward, we plan to integrate or switch between different providers to optimize Swap transactions and enhance the user experience. Potential partners include:

- [odos](https://www.odos.xyz/)
- [cow](https://cow.fi/)

#### Indexing Service (Indexer)

Data indexing is crucial for Web3 applications. We have conducted multiple experiments and evaluated various products to identify the best solution for our application scenarios. In the future, we will continue refining our indexing integration, exploring different technical solutions to enhance data retrieval efficiency, stability, and security to support business growth.

### Cloud Server Management

To ensure service stability, security, and cost efficiency, we leverage multiple cloud service providers. We will continue maintaining and managing these servers to ensure optimal performance while remaining flexible to accommodate different application requirements.

#### Servers Monitoring

We plan to upgrade our existing server monitoring solutions to provide developers with real-time insights into server performance, preventing unexpected disruptions.

Given the architectural differences among cloud service providers, this initiative presents several challenges and will require long-term improvements to achieve a unified and efficient monitoring system.

### DevSecOps Operations and Maintenance

#### Blockchain Node Management

We manage and maintain blockchain nodes, including Darwinia and Crab nodes such as Bootnode, RPC, and Collator nodes, ensuring their efficient operation and enhancing network stability. Additionally, we offer professional operational support, assisting node operators with upgrades, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

#### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD)

To support efficient team collaboration, we provide comprehensive CICD solutions, allowing developers to focus on business development without being distracted by build and deployment processes. Any CICD-related requests are welcome, and we will offer full technical support.

#### Infrastructure Expense Management and Support

We handle budget and reimbursement management for infrastructure-related expenses, including cloud services, third-party tools, and software costs. Additionally, we provide recommendations and support to ensure efficient budget utilization, optimizing operational costs.
