# Deliverables

## Sites & Documentation

- **Sites Update & Maintenance**: Oversee the status of the RingDAO, Darwinia, MsgPort, and XAPI websites, ensuring a modern design and a user-friendly experience.
- **Documentation Support**: Provide comprehensive documentation support for RingDAO, including official documentation (Darwinia docs, MsgPort docs, XAPI docs, website content, etc.) and community documentation (tutorials, monthly reports, collaborative documents).

## Application Coordination

- **ParaLink App**: Add support for the Darwinia chain, release the stable version, and expand its user base within the broader Polkadot ecosystem.
- **DeGov App**: Complete the first version of the DeGov app, initially making it available on RingDAO, DCDAO, and KTON DAO, and then integrate the XAccount feature.
- **Darwinia Ens App**: Release the first version of the Darwinia Ens app, make it accessible to all users on RingDAO, and subsequently integrate it into the RingDAO applications.
- **Track & Monitor**: Monitor the progress of all applications within RingDAO, identify potential issues, and ensure timely resolution.

## Security Audit

- **Runtime Upgrade Audit**: Provide a comprehensive audit of the runtime upgrade process to ensure the security and integrity of the Darwinia chain.
- **Application Feature Audit**: Provide a detailed audit of the key features of the applications within the RingDAO ecosystem to identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities.

## Research & Development

### Darwinia Chain

##### Development

- **Runtime Development**: Continuous enhancement and maintenance of the runtime environment to guarantee optimal performance and security. 
- **Node Development**: Ongoing improvements to Darwinia's core node infrastructure to maintain scalability and stability.
