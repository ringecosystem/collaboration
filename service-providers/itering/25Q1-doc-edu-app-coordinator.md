### Documentation

High-quality documentation is crucial for the success of any project, as it helps attract new users and assists existing users in understanding the project better. This service will provide comprehensive documentation support for RingDAO, divided into two main categories:

1. **Official Documentation**: This includes support for products within RingDAO, such as Darwinia docs, MsgPort docs, XAPI docs, website content, etc. These documents will be maintained long-term, updated according to product changes, and regularly polished.
2. **Community Documentation**: This includes tutorials, monthly reports, and collaborative documents with other projects. These documents are essential and more flexible to accommodate community needs.

### Community Education

Building a strong and active community around RingDAO is essential. This service aims to bridge the gap between regular users and developers, ensuring a healthy and engaged community. The community education support includes:

* Gathering and analyzing community feedback to improve products.
* Collaborating with the marketing team and community members to organize online/offline events such as hackathons and AMAs.
* Providing training and Q&A sessions for active community members to become community leaders, helping them organize and strengthen the community.

### Application Coordination

With the increasing number of applications built around RingDAO, it is crucial to ensure they are well-integrated, maintained, and updated. This service provides application coordination support, including:

* Acting as a bridge between application users and the technical team, gathering user feedback, and ensuring timely resolution of issues.
* Reviewing all applications within RingDAO to ensure they are on the right track, identifying potential issues, and resolving them promptly.
* Collaborating with developers and UX designers to ensure timely and high-quality application delivery.
