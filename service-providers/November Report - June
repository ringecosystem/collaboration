Wrote two articles on DeGov, both sharing DeGov values. Articles can be found in the doc. 
Designed a few graphics for some content.
The purpose of my content is to leave a trace of DeGov on X, and constantly feed the TL about DeGOv. 
Although X's November impressions were against creators, I pulled a few views and engagement this month.

For December, I have a few articles to plan and add quoting of projects to give DeGov more visibility.
