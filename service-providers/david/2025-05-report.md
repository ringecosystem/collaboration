In  May 2025, My initiatives centered around these:
--- Test and Review Campaign progress: Got a feedback from Kyosi, head of ecosystem for Quill Audits.
--- Warming up leads: Warming up 5 primary lead(s) through social interactions.
--- Bringing to notice application for AllianceDAO funding and comms to receive advice and feedback from Simon(head of growth, AllianceDAO)
--- Article progress: Publlished an X thread article about the review from Kyoshi (https://x.com/ai_degov/status/1924726399408939244).This lay emphasis that review style articles draw attention. This did 962 views.
--- Social Media promotions: In the last week of May, I replied to DAO delegates from other platforms like tally and will keep expanding the reach.
--- Team Sync: Joined 2 weekly syncs with Furqan


In June 2025, I will focus on:
--- Pushing the test and review campaign 
--- Set up discovery call with the team at Virtuals or Gitfish or any similar project
--- Warming up the leads more frequently and try to secure a close.
--- Share funding opportunities
--- Talk to 200 more DAO delegates using DeGov X's account.

Thank you and look forward to feedback
