JUNE MARKETING REPORT (DAVID)

1. Video production and promotion for DeGov.AI agent launch; got traction, attracted new eyes, and I shared across many chats I'm on.

2. Also shared video update with ValleyDAO, and a few other leads and attended ValleyDAO Discord community call, vibing and connecting. 

3. Still sharing our application(DeGov.Ai) to industry leaders and getting reviews.
