Here are the accomplishments for the month of August:

1. Product Demo for ENS DAO: This was a 10 minutes sessionon the MetaGov stewards call, and how DeGov is used. The meeting agenda where this occurred can be found here. https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-2025-meetings-tuesdays-at-2pm-utc-currently-10-00-am-et/20078/62?u=partnershipdude

2. Product Demo for Unlock Protocol DAO: In same vein, Demo was also done on the Unlock Weekly sync and DeGov.AI has been added across Unlock social channels as a recognized DAO platform. We also got a mention on Unlock Protocol's Farcaster as a result of this action.

3. Feedback collection from these two DAOs: Most of the feedback collected were asked as questions on the RingDAO Telegram chats and replies sent back to DAO members who asked those questions.

4. Attendance of 5 weekly meetings in ENS DAO and 3 weekly meetings in Unlock Protocol: This effort is aimed at relationship building.

5. Research and update KOL and Delegate list for DAOs to be onboarded on DeGov.AI: This reseach was done for 6 DAOs already onboarded on apps.degov.ai, where I scouted for top delegates and key opinion leaders in these respective DAOs.

6. Support other DAOs.

In September,
1. Submit proposal on ENS DAO to solve a curent problem(reducing inactive delegates) and should attract DAO support in the future to generate revenue
2. Submit proposal on behalf of DeGov.AI on Unlock Protocol and should attract revenue.
3. Attend weekly calls in these DAOs to keep the connection fresh.
4. With recent redirection; focus should now be on filtering and priming leads to be closed, in conjunction with Furqan.

Let's keep growing.
