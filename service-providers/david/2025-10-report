OCTOBER MONTHLY REPORT

Overview:
In the month of October, my focus shifted to how content can be utilized to spread DeGov.AI.

Here's the breakdown:

1. CONTENT STRATEGY LAUNCH: A content strategy is very important in today's digital economy and that's why I did this launch. Built a content strategy that anchors on a voice style perfect for DeGov. See strategy here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XeS38cLpf6-AOhAbuknDlSdB2JpykrS1T5epgRTFAWY/edit?usp=sharing.
Also included here, is a weekend analysis to see how the posts performed over the week.

2. Published content in investigation format: Investigations is a highly sought after niche in the DAO content world. See format here; https://x.com/PartnershipDude/status/1982744560276287902. With consistency and volume, viral threads can be achieved and more relevance in the DAO space.

3. 40 content posts; consisting quote posts, threads, and shitposts: Here the catch is volume while trying to improve quality. 

Impact:
1. Establishing Partnership Dude as a key opinion leader about DAOs(search the word DAO and most of my posts appear on the X filter)
2. Increased Brand Visibility.
3. Sets the path for viral threads in November.


Feedback Questions:
1. What content subtopics should I include?
2. What do you think about the current content style?
3. What do you think about a Tiktok account for DeGov?
