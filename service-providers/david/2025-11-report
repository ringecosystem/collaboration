NOVEMBER REPORT (DAVID)

Links: https://www.tiktok.com/@degov.ai and https://x.com/partnershipdude 

In the month of November, I did write a few threads, created a TikTok account, pushed  out 3 videos, supported all ai_DeGOv's X post amplification, and got re-directions on how tho contribute to the growth and development of the project. However, it is saddening to announce that this is my last offical month collaborating with the project for the meantime as I cannot continue this way for personal reasons and engagements, as well as team alignment and vision.
----------------------------------------------------
Super grateful for the opportunity to contribute thus far and wish DeGov a successful time ahead as the team navigaets through this bearish time.
To the friends and family I made during the time well spent here, you have a special place in my heart as I learned a lot about values, personal growth and grit from each and everyone.
To that end, I say a very big thank you to the RingDAO and I will keep supporting from the sidelines, and in rooms where RingDAO/DeGov/any other product of ours needs to be mentioned.
------------------------------------------------------
I will be navigating this transition phase and will ask for recommendations from teammates and friends. I hope to see everyone at the top in the nearest future.

Yours in governance,
PD.
