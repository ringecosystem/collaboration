# March 2025 Report

This report builds on the progress from the [February 2025 Report](https://github.com/ringecosystem/collaboration/pull/111/files) and focuses on the quieter but important groundwork done throughout March. The month centered on nurturing ETHDenver connections, advancing long-term plans for **Helixbox** and **DeGOV**, and initiating local engagement efforts.

## üîÑ Post-ETHDenver Engagement & Momentum

With ETHDenver concluded, March focused on maintaining the momentum generated:

- Continued conversations with ETHDenver contacts to keep relationships warm and ready for activation.
- Identified key individuals and groups for deeper engagement, especially aligned with Helixbox and DeGOV‚Äôs evolving plans.
- Avoided premature asks, instead focusing on ensuring these relationships remain engaged and receptive.

## üè´ Local University Outreach

Recognizing the value of grassroots engagement, I began building relationships with local university student bodies:

- Initiated connections with student-led blockchain groups and tech clubs.
- Laying the foundation for a **mini university hackathon**, which will serve as both a talent pipeline and early user engagement for Ring Ecosystem, if we later decide to execute on that.

## üéØ Internal Progress & Strategy

Beyond relationship-building, internal efforts were focused on preparation and structure:

### 1. Long-Term Planning
- Worked on preping myself on strategic objectives for both **Helixbox** and **DeGOV**, aligning with ecosystem trends and upcoming opportunities.

### 2. Recalibrating Priorities
- March also marked a shift of focus toward dedicating more attention to **DeGOV**, alongside the continued development of **Helixbox**.

## üîú Looking Ahead to April

With foundational work done in March, April will be action-oriented:

- **DeGOV** ‚Äî begin execution on DeGOV‚Äôs core initiatives, helping with brand, narritives and growth plans.
- **Helixbox** ‚Äî capitalize on existing relationships to move towards integrations and partnerships.
- **University Hackathon Planning** ‚Äî formalize and announce the mini hackathon in collaboration with local universities. (This after a steering committee call, have been decided to be moved at lower priority.)
- **Funding Opportunities** ‚Äî continue grant and ecosystem fund applications, building on earlier groundwork.
