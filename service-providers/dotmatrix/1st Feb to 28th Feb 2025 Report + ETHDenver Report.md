# **February 2025 Report**  

This report follows the updates from the [January 2025 Report](https://github.com/orgs/dcdao/discussions/212) and highlights the key activities and developments throughout February. The focus this month was on preparing for **ETHDenver**, finalizing key materials for **Helixbox**, and engaging with new funding opportunities.

## ðŸš€ **ETHDenver Preparation & Execution**  

February was largely dedicated to **ETHDenver**â€”from logistical planning to executing on the ground. This involved:  

- Coordinating travel, accommodations, and logistics.  
- Connecting with key ecosystem players and identifying funding opportunities.  
- Representing **Helixbox, Darwinia, and RingDAO** in strategic discussions.  

### **ETHDenver Report**  

REF: [Tally Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/dcdao/proposal/75533383416732532674021614855182711255065383272588408063790794225425154257993)  

I am making this post-event report to share what was done, learned, who was connected with, and what the next steps forward areâ€”including an explanation on the budget.  

ETHDenver was a first for me, for Darwinia, RingDAO, and now Helixbox! I enjoyed representing our brands out in public, had several conversationsâ€”but most importantly, I used this conference not to make new groups (as you must have noticed) but to figure out what is hot and printing money and who can get me in touch when needed.** I noticed from the last conference that **it is better to make asks when specifically required instead of making a group that will go deadâ€”especially if we aren't ready.

Although I didnâ€™t directly connect with some of the people mentioned [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UOXt4e5UXedotYI7K4fxxLXeItlacPyZf7b4eHFaM0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7tgskrsvqsnd) due to the sheer scale of the event, the key takeaway is that Iâ€™ve established strong enough ties within the ecosystem to find the right connections when needed. The network built at ETHDenver ensures that when we need to reach someone, we can. Additionally, KTON DAO asks are outlined in the detailed report below as well.

## ðŸ”œ **Looking Ahead**  

With ETHDenver wrapped up, March will focus on:  

- **Following up on ETHDenver connections** and securing next steps with key ecosystem partners.  
- **Grant applications**â€”June will be working on securing funding from **Berachain, Monad, and Suiâ€™s grant programs.**  
- **Exploring integrations**â€”Assessing how **Helixbox can work within Monadâ€™s ecosystem**, given recent confirmation of their **ecosystem fund.**  

February was a **heavy execution month**, balancing ETHDenver preparation while pushing forward Helixbox initiatives. With the groundwork laid, March will be about turning these opportunities into concrete outcomes.
