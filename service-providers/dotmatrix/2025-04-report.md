A lot of my tangible works is present [here](https://www.notion.so/anmolnetwork/RingDAO-Ecosystem-Growth-6eb34306654e406bbd9d61b74e0beb2b?p=1df50186676980cf937ff5e3847aab62&pm=s)

This month I was a bit sick — but that gave me enough time to sit and think, make squiggly notes, and test interfaces.  
I'm grateful for everyone's patience.

We might be constricted on budget, but we have potential — a dedicated team and a good outlook.

As always - I am more than open for feedback!!
