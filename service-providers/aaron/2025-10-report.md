## Bug Fixes

## Impact

Stability improved by automating treasury asset tracking and quorum calculations, reducing manual configuration errors and operational overhead. UX clarity advanced through consistent dashboard component styling, clearer proposal action previews, and guided governance workflows, which should reduce user confusion and support requests. Maintainability increased as unified component patterns and automated data synchronization keep the system aligned with on-chain reality, making future feature toggles and configuration changes lower risk.
