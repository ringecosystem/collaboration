## PR Activity (December)

- degov: 24 commits and 23 PR merges. Completed Next.js security upgrades (16.0.7/16.0.10), multiple rounds of performance optimization, and governance data correctness fixes (BigInt handling, last-vote timestamp, useConfigSWR config fetching/caching).

- degov-essential: 3 commits and 2 PR merges. Upgraded Next.js to 15.3.8 with dependency adjustments.

## Key Milestones

- Addressed a critical Next.js vulnerability with coordinated upgrades across repos (degov 16.0.7/16.0.10; home/essential 15.3.8; square 15.5.7 → 15.5.9).
- Delivered multi-dimensional front-end performance improvements: responsive rendering, dynamic loading for heavy pages, unified query/caching strategies, and optimized block sampling and batch requests.
- Shipped governance UI correctness fixes (treasury assets display, delegate last-voted refresh, AI agent tag consistency) and reduced noisy UI surfaces.
- Fixed degov-square subscription/notification view layout and display issues, stabilizing subscriber-facing UX.
- Implemented a unified config fetching/caching path via useConfigSWR in December (merged the following month but developed in December).

## Bug Fixes

- Data consistency: treasury manual-asset display, delegate last-voted status refresh, subscribed DAO rendering, and vote-related BigInt handling.
- UI correctness: consistent AI agent tag logic between homepage and delegates list; removal of the outdated X proposal link; notification layout fixes.
- Governance clarity: removed agent voting comment decision details to align with updated logic and reduce confusion.
- Performance: unified refetch strategies and placeholder data, optimized cache initialization and block sampling to reduce interaction lag.

## Impact

- Security: Next.js upgrades reduced exposure to known vulnerabilities and improved baseline safety.
- Stability: fewer stale or inconsistent displays across treasury, delegates, subscriptions, and notifications.
- Performance: smoother primary flows with lower perceived latency.
- UX clarity: simpler information surfaces and consistent labeling improved navigation and decision confidence.
- Maintainability: useConfigSWR and standardized query strategies support easier future evolution.
