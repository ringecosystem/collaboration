### Key Milestones

- Notifications and expanded theme options launched together, pairing timely alerts with customizable visuals so contributors stay engaged without sacrificing readability.
- Indexer instrumentation and new query fields were delivered, shrinking lag between on-chain events and dashboard insights while reducing manual verification workload.

### Bug Fixes

- Layout polish — Cleaned up hover states on dashboards, enforced left-aligned tables, and stabilized proposal cards so critical metadata no longer shifts on interaction.
- Context clarity — Added structured proposer details, refined delegate popups, and surfaced voting balances to eliminate guesswork around ownership and authority.
- Data integrity — Tightened the indexer status bar, enabled block-aware vote retrieval, and removed conflicting profile email fields to keep tallies accurate against quorum rules.
- Front-end responsiveness — Resolved column alignment regressions in apps and ensured fixed headers keep key controls available when scrolling large data sets.

### Impact

- Stability — Indexer telemetry and block-number aware vote queries cut false error signals during high-traffic periods, keeping dashboards dependable for governance sessions.
- UX clarity — Unified layouts and richer context cues shorten ramp-up time for reviewers and reduce navigation churn across governance consoles and companion apps.
- Adoption & trust — Notification support, theme customization, and the refreshed degov.ai home experience combine to create a more personal, predictable journey that encourages delegates and newcomers to stay informed.
- Maintainability — Consistent data presentation and removal of redundant profile fields simplify downstream automation and lower the cost of future UI iterations.
