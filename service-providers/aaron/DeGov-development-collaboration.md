## Summary

I propose an ongoing, month-to-month collaboration to provide core frontend development for DeGov.AI and its related repositories. This arrangement removes quarterly timeboxes and enables continuous delivery across the DeGov ecosystem.

## Scope of Work

I will contribute across DeGov and related repos, including but not limited to:

- `ringecosystem/degov`
- `ringecosystem/degov-essential`
- `ringecosystem/degov-square`
- `ringecosystem/degov-home`
- (plus new or satellite repos as needed)

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Issue Resolution & Platform Stability**

   - Triage, fix, and verify frontend issues reported by the community and core team.
   - Maintain release quality with reproducible test cases and post-fix validation.

2. **Feature Development**

   - Implement new UI features based on product/governance needs.
   - Ensure clean API integration, type safety, and performance.

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**

   - Improve clarity, accessibility, responsiveness, and cross-browser consistency.
   - Encourage component reuse and design-system alignment to reduce maintenance cost.

4. **DAO Onboarding Support**

   - Unblock new DAOs with fast turnaround on frontend blockers.
   - Optimize onboarding flows and interfaces to reduce friction.

5. **Ecosystem Maintenance**

   - Keep dependencies current, improve build times and bundle size.
   - Strengthen documentation (README, runbooks, contribution notes).

## Deliverables & Process

- **Monthly work log & summary:** issues closed, PRs merged, features shipped, metrics/notes.
- **Release artifacts:** tested builds and migration notes when applicable.
- **Documentation updates:** user-facing notes and developer docs for new features.
- **Community responsiveness:** timely follow-ups on discussions and bug reports.

## Collaboration

- Ad-hoc sync when needed to align on priorities and unblock work.
- Open PRs early, iterate with reviewers, and keep scope transparent.

## Quality & Success Criteria

- Faster resolution of high-priority frontend issues (MTTR improves month over month).
- Reduced regressions (lower reopen rate).
- Maintained or improved performance/accessibility scores on key surfaces.
- Smoother DAO onboarding (fewer support pings, faster time-to-resolution).

## Timeline

**Monthly – Indefinite – Based on mutual agreement.**
Either party may end or modify this collaboration with notice (e.g., one billing cycle).
