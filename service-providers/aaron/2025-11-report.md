## Key Milestones

- **Next.js 16 Upgrade Completed**: Successfully migrated the core framework to Next.js 16 to boost performance and stability. Key advantages include:
  - **Turbopack Integration**: significantly faster build times and smoother development workflows.
  - **React Compiler Stability**: automatic memoization reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Overall Performance Optimization (In-Progress)**: Executing a comprehensive optimization plan with a **40% completion rate** in November.
  - _Strategic Note_: Performance optimization is established as a continuous, long-term initiative. Iterations will proceed indefinitely beyond current targets to ensure best-in-class responsiveness.
- **Delegate Management Improved**: Delegate tab now shows delegators and supports richer sorting, making representation choices clearer.
- **Profile Page Refactor**: Delivered cleaner layout and readability for member profiles.
- **Base Mini App Support Unlocked**: Covers embedded clients within partner platforms.
- **Wallet Session Alignment**: Token lifetime now matches wallet connection session to avoid premature expiry.

## Bug Fixes

- UI clarity: profile page restructuring removed layout glitches; delegate tab visuals polished.
- List accuracy: delegate list sorting enhanced to surface relevance and voting weight consistently.
- Auth/session stability: token lifespan tied to wallet session reduces unexpected re-auth prompts.
- Platform compatibility: base mini app support resolves launch gaps on the embedded base environment.

## Impact

- **Technical Robustness**: The Next.js 16 upgrade and ongoing performance work lay a solid foundation for future scalability, reducing technical debt and interaction latency.
- UX clarity: navigation around delegates and profiles is simpler, speeding up representative selection.
- Stability & trust: aligned session lifetimes lower logout surprises, improving completion rates for on-chain actions.
- Adoption: base mini app support opens access for mobile and embedded scenarios, widening the reachable user base.
- Maintainability: refactored profile module and sorting logic reduce future change risk.
