# Bounty Program

We will rate the issues in Darwinia and invite community developers to help with the fix. Community developers can get rewards after fixing the issue and being reviewed. The rewards for fixing different levels of issue will be different.

## Issue rating and fix review

The Issue rating and fix review will be officially completed by Darwinia and will be followed by the Github repository admin.

We only reward developers who submitted PR which fix issues and finally get merged.

## Reward

We will tag different issues with different rewards. Most of the issue rewards range from $50 to $450. You can view the details on [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/).
