# SubAPI DAO

## Description

SubAPI DAO is targeting to be a SubDAO of Darwinia, working on Oracle and API integration. The SubAPI solution, developed by SubAPI DAO, is based on API3's airnode. Darwinia Msgport is set to adopt the services provided by this SubAPI solution.

## Why is this project good for the Darwinia ecosystem?

SubAPI DAO is an independent organization that provides Oracle solutions for Msgport and is used by Darwinia Msgport as the default oracle component.

## How you will integrate this project into Darwinia?

SubAPI DAO has deployed the subAPI on the Darwinia Network (Darwinia EVM), enabling the ORMP protocol to retrieve message root from other chains.

## Team

- Aki (Airnode Operator)
- Echo Hu (Airnode Operator)
- Guantong Ji (Airnode Operator)
- Nada (Airnode Operator)
- Yalin Cai (Airnode Operator)

## Legal Structure

SubAPI currently operates as a Dapp created by the SubAPI DAO team without a defined legal structure.

## Collaborative Grant Proposal and Current Development

### Proposal

1. Operate and maintain Airnode to fulfill ORMP message root requests.

### SubAPI DAO Solutions

#### ORMP Oracle (Already Launched)

This version deliver message roots between Ethereum, Arbitrum and Darwinia, enabling Msgport ORMP to verify the truth of messages.

## Future Development Roadmap

The following milestones are not included in the collaboration grant assessment and are included to communicate SubAPI DAO team's vision and direction.

- Lower Oracle fees
- More networks
- Price feed
- Random number

## Collaboration Funding

* Total funding amount: 1 ETH
* SubAPI DAO address: 0x000000000a0D8ac9cc6CbD817fA77090322FF29d
* Network: Ethereum

The fund, paid in ETH, is dedicated to supporting Airnode in responding to gas price fluctuations on the Ethereum network. With this funding, SubAPI aims to reduce the cost for dApps to use Msgport on the Ethereum network. Gas prices can be set at an average value to charge users, eliminating the need for excessively high fees to ensure the normal fulfillment of Airnode.

The 1st payment date: After SubAPI completes the support Ethereum and Darwinia business upgrade PR merge, with the address being 0x00000000096c285629Fe3EAb3dd042c27b9dcBa6 on Darwinia or Ethereum.

## Additional Information

### What work has been done so far?

SubAPI has supported 6 networks, includes Darwinia, Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Crab, Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia.

### Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

On the Darwinia Network, SubAPI is the first oracle project.

### Competition

There are no competitors on the Darwinia Network.
