## Degov UI

### Project Description

Degovernance Platform is an open-source DAO governance solution designed to address the current limitations of existing governance tools. The platform aims to provide a flexible, cross-chain compatible interface that seamlessly integrates with OpenZeppelin Governance standards while prioritizing the on-chain governance needs of Darwinia Chain and RingDAO ecosystem.

This project focuses on developing an extensible governance platform that enables efficient DAO operations, enhanced participation, and seamless cross-chain integration. By leveraging open-source principles and modern governance frameworks, it seeks to eliminate vendor lock-in issues present in current closed-source solutions like Tally.

This platform will serve as a crucial infrastructure piece for the Darwinia ecosystem, enabling more efficient and accessible DAO governance while supporting the broader vision of cross-chain interoperability.
