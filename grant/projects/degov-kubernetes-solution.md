# DeGov Kubernetes Host Solution

## Brief Description

This proposal aims to implement a Kubernetes-based hosting solution for DeGov platform to replace the current hosting infrastructure, providing improved scalability, reliability, and ease of management.

## Team

### Team Members

- [XQ Partners Limited]
- [Yalin Cai](https://github.com/fewensa) from Itering

## Grant Information

- Estimated Duration: 2 weeks
- Cost: 1000 USD
- Address: 0x5279278A390076459A82e1b7ccE6D1c56093c4c1

## Solution Details

### Technical Details

This Kubernetes hosting solution for DeGov platform provides a high-availability, secure, and maintainable cloud-native environment.

#### Core Architecture

- **GitOps-based**: All infrastructure and applications managed through code, ensuring consistency and traceability
- **Automated CI/CD**: Complete pipeline from code commit to production deployment using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD
- **Security-focused**: Network policies, secret management, and access control following best practices
- **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for system health and performance

#### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Kubernetes** | DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) | Container orchestration and management |
| **Ingress** | Nginx Ingress Controller | HTTP/HTTPS routing and load balancing |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions + ArgoCD | Automated build, test, and deployment |
| **Configuration** | Kustomize | GitOps configuration management |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana | Metrics collection and visualization |
| **Logging** | Loki + Grafana | Centralized log management |
| **Database** | DigitalOcean PostgreSQL | Managed database service |

#### Deployment Flow

1. Code push triggers GitHub Actions to build Docker images
2. Images pushed to GitHub Package Registry
3. GitOps repository updated with new image tags
4. ArgoCD detects changes and deploys to Kubernetes cluster
5. Auto-scaling adjusts resources based on demand

#### Business Isolation

- **Namespaces**: Separate namespaces for different DAOs
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory quotas per namespace
- **Network Security**: Restricted inter-namespace communication

### Delivery Details

- A reliable and scalable Kubernetes hosting solution for DeGov platform, support at least 3 DAOs powered by degov, including the demo-dao, demo-blocknumber-dao, demo-no-timelock-dao.
- Comprehensive documentation and training materials for developers and operators working with the new Kubernetes infrastructure.
- Automated deployment and management of the Kubernetes infrastructure, including CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and logging.
- Integration with existing DeGov services and infrastructure, ensuring a seamless transition to the new hosting solution.

## Additional Information

Please note that Degov is a cross-team collaboration project, with other contributions coming from Itering, including Bear Wang, Yalin Cai and others, has provided crucial development work on core solution architecture and indexing infrastructure. Their expertise and contributions have been instrumental in building a robust foundation for the platform. Since Itering's contributions are provided separately as a Service Provider of RingDAO, the grant amount does not include compensation for these efforts. The entirety of this grant's rewards will be allocated to snoopy1412 for completing the grant scope, with Itering providing the necessary support.
