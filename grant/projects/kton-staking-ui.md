# Darwinia KTON Staking UI

## Description

This is a Darwinia RFP.

This project is a frontend user interface for the new KTON Staking. [DIP-5](https://github.com/darwinia-network/DIPs/pull/15) proposes some adjustments to the KTON staking, which will separate the KTON Staking from Collator Staking while keeping incentive for ring pool and kton pool unchanged.

## Why is this project good for the Darwinia ecosystem?

This project will provide a clear and easy KTON Staking web UI to users.

Without this UI, users will manually interact with the new KTON Staking contract. This could be a big obstacle for non-tech users to stake their KTON. More convenient staking can not only help KTON holders obtain more rewards, but will also make Darwinia Chain more active.
