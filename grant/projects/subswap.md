# Subswap

## Project Name

Subswap —— AMM DEX based on Darwinia DVM. https://subswap.pro

### Project Description

Subswap is an automated liquidity protocol powered by a constant product formula ( x * y = K ) and implemented in a system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the Darwinia DVM. Subswap is an open-source software.

Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.
