# Evolution Land

## Description

Evolution Land is the first Metaverse + Gamefi + cross-chain game with each continent built on different blockchain networks, such as the first Atlantis continent. The game will have up to 26 continents, each of which is deployed on a different public chain. Four continents have been built so far and have been deployed on Ethereum (Atlantis Continent), Tron (Byzantine), Columbus (Crab Network), Dawning (Heco) and Eden(Polygon).

Evolution Land integrates various gameplays, including management, collection, education, gene, battle, auction, and game, which will continuously be evolving.

One Dapp One Community Metaverse 10+ projects have announced plans to build communities in Evolution Land to present project information and give back rewards to the community fans.

## Why is this project is good for the Crab ecosystem?

1. Evolution Land is the first build GameFi project on Crab Smart Chain. Evolution Land has been built on four networks - Ethereum, Tron, HECO, and Polygon. Each of them has at least 200,000+ $RING TVL. It will definately bring more TVL on Crab Smart Chain.
2. Evolution Land has 1000+ DAU from HECO, Ethereum, Tron, and Polygon. And will build on BSC and Moonriver in the future. It could introduce more users and assets from other chains.
3. Multi-chain and cross-chain is an important gameplay on Evolution Land. This point is similar to the Darwinia Bridge.

## How you will integrate this project into Crab?

Evolution Land will take the advantage of EVM module on Crab Smart Chain. We will deploy our contract(ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) on CSC. We already deployed our alpha version for testing. Once our beta is released we will enable the community and Darwinia to start minting and playing.
