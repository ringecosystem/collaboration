# ParaLink

## Project Overview

[ParaLink](https://para.link) is a cross-chain asset exchange hub built on the Polkadot XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) technology stack to serve users of parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem. The current version only supports tokens in the Darwinia ecosystem, and the user experience needs improvement. This grant aims to redesign and rebuild ParaLink, from the user interface to the underlying logic, to make it more user-friendly and efficient.

## Grant Information

- **Key Contributor**: Snoopy1412
- **Estimated Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Budget**: 2500 USD
- **Payee Wallet Address**: 0x3d6d656c1bf92f7028Ce4C352563E1C363C58ED5

### Tasks

#### Infrastructure and Core Feature Development

1. **User Interface Development**

   - Build the project’s foundational architecture using React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui.
   - Create a user-friendly interface to optimize the user workflow.
   - Implement comprehensive responsive design to ensure compatibility across multiple devices.
   - Integrate TanStack Query for efficient server-side state management.

2. **Web3 Integration**

   - Integrate wagmi, viem, and RainbowKit to enable interactions with EVM-compatible chains.
   - Integrate @polkadot/api and @polkadot/extension-dapp to facilitate interactions with Polkadot chains.
   - Implement intelligent chain type recognition based on user selection, automatically switching to the corresponding wallet login and interaction logic.

3. **Smart XCM Design**

   - **HRMP Channel Smart Detection**

     - Implement **automatic detection of HRMP channels between Polkadot parallel chains** to determine chain pairs eligible for XCM transfers.
     - Utilize on-chain storage data to retrieve information on all currently active parallel chain channels.

   - **Chain Type and Asset Type Smart Recognition**

     - **Automatically detect whether the target chain is an EVM-compatible chain or a Polkadot chain**, dynamically adjusting the cross-chain transfer logic and process.
     - **Automatically detect and identify asset types**, determining whether assets are native tokens, synthetic assets, or tokens on EVM chains.

   - **Automated Asset Information Retrieval**

     - **Automatically add supported asset pairs** to ParaLink, supporting a broader range of assets and reducing manual configuration and communication costs with project teams.
     - Provide querying and filtering functionalities for asset pairs to facilitate users in selecting the assets they wish to transfer.
     - Reference the [XCM Global Registry](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/xcm-global-registry/tree/action/assets/polkadot) to implement the retrieval and parsing of asset Location information.
     - Tailor asset information retrieval to accommodate differences in on-chain asset management modules across various chains.
     - Implement custom handling for **special assets** that cannot be processed automatically, ensuring their support within ParaLink.

   - **Frontend Display Optimization**

     - Handle the display of **Token and Network Logos** on the frontend, prioritizing data acquisition from [Subscan Assets Info](https://github.com/subscan-explorer/assets-info) and using default icons if necessary.
     - Ensure accurate display of asset and network information on the frontend, providing users with clear information.

   - **Cross-Chain Transfer Logic Enhancement**

     - **Implement cross-chain asset transfer logic between EVM chains and Polkadot chains**, enabling users to transfer assets across different types of chains.
     - Manage various potential exceptions during the cross-chain process to ensure asset security.
     - Dynamically adjust the cross-chain transfer logic and process based on automatically detected chain types and asset types.

## PREPLK Distribution Commitment

To express our gratitude for RingDao's funding support for this grant and the previous research, design and development work, ParaLink has launched an ERC-20 token on the Darwinia mainnet called [PREPLK (Pre ParaLink Token)](https://explorer.darwinia.network/address/0x7ED13f74FD8AE70db03Ae74666d1B443341D8A41), and has committed to distribute 20% of the total supply to the RingDAO Ecosystem Multisig after the grant finish deliver. We hope that ParaLink would be a valuable part of the RingDAO ecosystem in the future and develop a long-term relationship with ParaLink.

## Additional Information

Please note that Paralink is a cross-team collaboration project, with other major contributions coming from Itering, including Bear Wang, Guantong, Jay, Yuqi, and others. Since Itering’s contributions are provided separately as a Service Provider of RingDAO, the grant amount does not include compensation for these efforts. The entirety of this grant’s rewards will be allocated to snoopy1412 for completing the grant scope, with Itering providing the necessary support.
