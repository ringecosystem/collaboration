# Helix Bridge
## **Project Description**
Helix Bridge is a fully open-source and decentralized cross-chain asset bridge. Built upon existing common messaging bridges between chains, Helix offers users secure, fast, and cost-effective cross-chain functionality. Currently supporting many evm-based chains, including Darwinia Network, Helix plans to expand its connections to more chains in collaboration with Darwinia.

Helix Bridge employs various asset cross-chain models to meet users' needs for rapid, secure, and low-cost cross-chain transactions. As an integral part of the Darwinia ecosystem, Helix continues to play a crucial role in connecting Darwinia with external ecosystems. Additionally, Helix leverages Darwinia's infrastructure, such as its secure universal bridge messaging channel, to further support Darwinia's infrastructure development.

### **Why is this project good for the Darwinia ecosystem**
1. Helix Bridge is the inaugural asset bridge on the Darwinia Network, facilitating asset bridging from Darwinia to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and supporting the native token RING across Darwinia, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Ethereum. This integration links the mainnet's RING and liquidity pools on other chains, serving as a gateway for users to transfer RING assets.

2. Helix Bridge has initiated stablecoin conversions among Layer 2 solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem, with plans to extend this functionality to the Darwinia mainnet. This will stimulate further development of the Darwinia EVM ecosystem.

### **How you will integrate this project into Darwinia**
Helix Bridge has deployed the token bridge on the Darwinia Network (Darwinia EVM), enabling users to swap assets between Darwinia and other networks. Relayers can earn fees from the system.

## **Collaborative Grant Proposal and Current Development**

### **Proposal**
1. Build and deploy the bridge on Darwinia & Crab Network.
2. Support Liquidity for Darwinia's native token RING.
3. Initiate marketing events for asset bridges between Darwinia Network and other chains.

## **Helix Solutions**

### **Helix xToken Bridge (Already Launched)**
This version maps Darwinia Network's RING and KTON to the Ethereum Network, having run stably for over a year. The solution enables decentralized issuance and redemption of Darwinia's assets on the Ethereum network, utilizing Darwinia's underlying general messaging infrastructure for reliability and security.

- Locking issuance and redemption of assets RING & KTON
- User-friendly transaction interface
- Transaction history indexing and display

### **Helix LnBridge V1.0 (Already Launched)**
This version is live between Darwinia and Ethereum, reducing user cross-chain costs and improving transaction speed. Security has been enhanced to a certain extent. This version would be upgrade to V3.0 near future.

### **Helix LnBridge V2.0 (Already Launched)**
This version is live between Darwinia and Arbitrum, further lowering user cross-chain costs through a collateral mechanism. It connects Darwinia to the Ethereum Layer 2 network.

### **Helix LnBridge V3.0 (Not Launched Yet)**
This version enhances user cross-chain transaction depth by removing the collateral mechanism. This update is designed to streamline the cross-chain experience and reduce relayer pledging costs.

## **Future Development Roadmap**
The following milestones are not included in the collaboration grant assessment and are included to communicate Helix Bridge team's vision and direction.

- Helix 3.0: represents a comprehensive solution that integrates xToken, LnBridge v2.0, and LnBridge v3.0, running concurrently and complementing each other.
- Achieve full interconnection of connected networks, reducing user asset cross-chain path lengths.
- Helix Dao
- Asset monitoring, user data analysis

## **Collaboration Funding**
Total funding amount: 3 ETH and 9,000,000 RING.

The first fund, paid in ETH, is dedicated to supporting Helix Bridge's network deployment expenses. With this funding, Helix aims to maximize cross-chain interconnectivity, minimizing the pathways to link the Darwinia Network with other ecosystems. The primary objective is to establish as many connections as possible, ensuring a robust and comprehensive network that facilitates seamless asset transfer.The second fund, paid in RING, will be utilized to provide liquidity support for RING assets. Helix Bridge commits not to expend this fund but rather engage in long-term staking to offer liquidity. The focus is on sustaining a continuous and stable provision of liquidity, contributing to the overall health and functionality of the Helix Bridge ecosystem.

The 1st payment date: After Helix completes the Darwinia to Ethereum xToken business upgrade PR merge, with the address being 0x88a39B052d477CfdE47600a7C9950a441Ce61cb4 on Arbitrum or Ethereum.

The 2nd payment date: After Helix completes the LnBridge v3 launch.

## **Additional Information**
Anyone can experience Helix cross-chain transfer transactions at https://helixbridge.app/ and register as a relayer to provide liquidity and earn cross-chain fees. Helix also offers a test network at https://testnet.helixbridge.app/ for user product experience.

### **What work has been done so far?**
Helix has connected over 10 chains, undergone multiple revisions to enhance user interaction, and currently has three cross-chain paths open on the Darwinia network.

### **Are there any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?**
No.

### **Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?**
On the Darwinia Network, Helix Bridge is the first asset bridge project.

### **Competition**
On other chains, competitors such as stargate, celebridge, orbiter, across protocol, etc., exist. Helix Bridge has its own unique implementation to address cross-chain asset issues effectively.
