## Project Description

Modern society is accelerating towards a future where our daily life is experienced increasingly in the digital realm. Currently digital assets are largely 
limited to the images, such as digitally native items in NFT art. This is a very narrow application of this powerful new technology and we envision a much wider 
spectrum of applications for digital assets.

MetaRock will offer a platform for everyday users and businesses to fully take advantage of the potential of these emerging technologies. We are working proactively
 to solve a future problem, a gap in the market which will emerge as the use of digital assets becomes more widespread. We are building a series of interfaces that 
 are specifically designed for each asset class. These interfaces, with their fluid logic and intuitive 
UI experience, will foster and expand the adoption of minting technology for the everyday user.

We aim to specialise in building a minting platform that business can digitise their real world assets by 3D images, making them metaverse compatible. MetaRock 
believes in the future all assets will be represented in the virtual world as well as in the physical world and will bridge the gap between the metaverse and the 
everyday individual.


### Why is this project is good for the Darwinia ecosystem:

MetaRock will build a marketplace on Darwinian and Crab network allowing Users to mint and sell NFTs natively in the Darwinia Ecosystem. MetaRock will also allow 
Darwinia Network's existing community to start trading and selling NFT art and resources on the Darwinia and Crab Blockchains, bringing utility to RING and CRAB.


### How you will integrate this project into Darwinia:

MetaRock is currently minting with rmrk1.0 and will follow rmrk2.0 and ERC 721 shortly. MetaRock is already minting NTFs on the Crab and Pangolin Blockchain with 
plans to build a community backed Liquidity pool to help build the communities local Dex liquidity. Once our beta is released we will enable the community and Darwinia
 to start minting and selling NFTs

## Collaborative Grant Proposal and Current Development

### Proposal 

Build and deploy MetaRock beta on Crab Network: a NFT platform based on the rmrk 1.0.0 protocol on CRAB native blockchain. This will allow MetaRock to acquire research 
on user's logic when wanting to create 
specific NFTs on different chains. This community driven information will allow MetaRock to refine multi-chain user logic and adapt it to each asset class that MetaRock
 builds a NFT minting pathway. This logic will allow the design of the overall architecture of Metarock.

Currently multichain user logic is untested. Blockchain technology is only just maturing to the point where users are exposed to decisions that have technical, financial 
and social pressures derived from different chains and their cultures. Creating friction and potentially hindering adoption by being too complicated.

MetaRock Minting platform and marketplace will provide the following to Darwinia and Crab community:

  - Utility to Crab networks native currency crab
  - Allow Darwina community to buy sell and swap crab native NFTs 
  - Add value to the Darwinia community by allowing sub-cultures to develop
  - Potentially allowing a direct pathway for Evolution Lands partners to mint assets to be used on Crabs soon to be release continent
  - Allow Darwina to sell exclusive NFTs and raise capital for the DAO
  - Allow Darwinia to sell merchandise
  - Increase community engagement and excitement 


## MetaRock Beta:

The beta version of MetaRock is what is applying for CRAB grant program, and the delivery scope has: 

  - Platform for testing and UI/UX optimisation
  - Basic NFT scan tool based on RMRK 1.0.0
  - AR/VR mobile capabilities 
  - 3D asset display capabilities 
  - Buy, sell, destroy and send functions
  - Documents on usage,test, etc., for final acceptance of product

The MetaRock beta version will be licensed in MIT, but MetaRock reserves the right to make future releases private if necessary.

MetaRocks Beta Acceptance Criteria will be the document, delivered by the MetaRock team into this repository - To be used by Darwinia, as a tool to gauge the successful delivery of MetaRock beta on CRAB network. 


## Future Development Roadmap 

The following milestones are not included in the collaboration grant assessment and is only here to communicate MetaRocks team's vision and direction.

### MetaRock 1.0

  - MetaClone Tool ( cloning tool used to clone Parent NFTs as they are sold )
  - Build on Numoriouse Blockchains and allow the Community to start selling items in their currency and generate their own income within that ecosystem.
  - Plug into metaverses allowing users to sell items in games and designers to sell Skins and ingame items.
  - Commence building DeFi Liquidity pools allowing buyers to buy in any currency and sellers to receive any currency as payment.


### Metarock 2.0: 

  - Liquidity pools 
  - Currency exchange allows sellers to receive funds in a specific currency and buyers to use a specific currency to make purchases. 
  - Referral based NFT sales smart contracts
  - Royalties 
  - NFT based access into Advance Minting Platform. 


### MetaRock 3.0:

  - Income tracking system / Profit and Loss report
  - Onchian Profiles 
  - Consist of smart contract based NFTs and goods ordering system. 
  - Insurance 
  - Privacy functions 


## Colabriation Funding  

Total funding amount: 6,000 USDT. Payment to be made in two instalments to the value of $ 3,000 USD.


The first installment is paid in RING to the value of $3,000 USD. The ratio of RING to determined by average rate of the prior week, set by the time of accepting the pull request. 
Price ratio to be generated by coinmarket.com or coingecko.com - if a automatited 7 day average is obtainable. The 7 day high + 7day low / 2 is also acceptable - allowing for
 8 points behind the decimal at each 7 day price point.
 
 
The second payment is paid in USDT to the value of $3,000 USD on completion of the acceptance criteria judged by Darwinia. 


## Additional Information

To trial our pre-beta product please go to: MetaRock.app. You will need the following:

  - Polkadot JS wallet
  - Kusama, Crab or Pring to mint or buy NFTs 


### What work has been done so far?

Metarock's minimum viable Product has been made and is nearing its beta testing phase which is to be tested by the Darwinia community in mid January 2022.


### Are there any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?

No. Currently Josiah Kotzur is the only funds contributor through hiring team members to help build.


### Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

Currently ecommerce has not entered into Web3.0 and there are not direct pathways for business and Designers to sell assets in the metaverse. As Web 3.0 matures we expect that 
all existing ecommerce will cross from Web 2.0 into Web 3.0and all assets will have a Digital representation, Therefore MetaRock’s market is equal to the global ecommerce market.

"The global ecommerce market is expected to total 4.89 Trillion in 2021. That figure is estimated to grow over the next few years, showing that borderless ecommerce is becoming 
a profitable option for online retailers." - https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics


### Competition

Through our research we have not found another platform offering 3D compatibility so at present MetaRock is entirely unique in its function.  
Currently all major ecommerce competitors are still using legacy web 2.0 infrastructure. MetaRock expects to connect web 2.0 and 3.0 ecommerce companies by enabling sellers mint 
with MetaRock and sell on both existing web 2.0 infrastructure as well as rapidly developing web 3.0 infrastructure.  
 
 
Web 3.0 ecommerce competitors
  - Nil
  
Existing web 2.0 ecommerce competitors
  - Ebay
  - Amazon
  - Etsy
  - Alibaba

## conclusion 
As with any new technology the early stage adoption is gradual. The wave of demand is looming and key figures such as Facebook are already laying the groundwork for what will become 
an industry standard. MetaRock is currently leading the way in decentralised commerce and minting technologies. We will be fully established as a decentralised ecommerce hub before 
this revolution takes place.
